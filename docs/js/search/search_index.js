DragAndDropModule.forRoot method was removed.

This may break some apps in some edge cases.\nThe dragStart $event.x and $event.y values were removed as these were always\n0\npointer-events:none is no longer automatically applied to elements while they are being dragged. To migrate use the dragActiveClass option and set this yourself with css\ndragCursor: The drag cursor will no longer be set to move by default, to restore the\nbehaviour set dragCursor=\"move\" or use CSS on the draggable elements to change the cursor\n\n\n3.0.1 (2018-06-05)\nBug Fixes\n\ndrag: style assignment for dragged element on IE (#33) (d0372ec), closes #29\n\n\n3.0.0 (2018-05-09)\nFeatures\n\nupgrade to angular 6 (d96c26e), closes #31\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nangular 6 and rxjs 6 or higher are now required to use this package\n\n\n2.0.0 (2017-12-26)\nBug Fixes\n\nonly call drag start and end outputs when the element is actually dragged (45c6b5f), closes #21 #20\n\nFeatures\n\nupgrade to angular 5 (4159ce2)\nuse lettable rxjs operators (9fca12a)\nuse ng-packagr for building the package (57dd436)\ndragPointerDown: add a new output to repliate the old dragStart behaviour (4a58c61)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nThe UMD module path has changed from\nangular-draggable-droppable/dist/umd/angular-draggable-droppable.js to\nangular-draggable-droppable/bundles/angular-draggable-droppable.umd.js.
