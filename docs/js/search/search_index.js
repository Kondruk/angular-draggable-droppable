To migrate just import the\nDragAndDropModule module directly\nthe drag helper provider is now no longer exported as part of the public api, just\nremove it from your code to migrate\nA cloned element is now created when the element is being dragged, and the dragged\nelement is set to be positioned fixed. This may break some apps in some edge cases.\nThe dragStart $event.x and $event.y values were removed as these were always\n0\npointer-events:none is no longer automatically applied to elements while they are being dragged. To migrate use the dragActiveClass option and set this yourself with css\ndragCursor: The drag cursor will no longer be set to move by default, to restore the\nbehaviour set dragCursor=\"move\" or use CSS on the draggable elements to change the cursor\n\n\n3.0.1 (2018-06-05)\nBug Fixes\n\ndrag: style assignment for dragged element on IE (#33) (d0372ec), closes #29\n\n\n3.0.0 (2018-05-09)\nFeatures\n\nupgrade to angular 6 (d96c26e), closes #31\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nangular 6 and rxjs 6 or higher are now required to use this package\n\n\n2.0.0 (2017-12-26)\nBug Fixes\n\nonly call drag start and end outputs when the element is actually dragged (45c6b5f), closes #21 #20\n\nFeatures\n\nupgrade to angular 5 (4159ce2)\nuse lettable rxjs operators (9fca12a)\nuse ng-packagr for building the package (57dd436)\ndragPointerDown: add a new output to repliate the old dragStart behaviour (4a58c61)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nThe UMD module path has changed from\nangular-draggable-droppable/dist/umd/angular-draggable-droppable.js to\nangular-draggable-droppable/bundles/angular-draggable-droppable.umd.js.
